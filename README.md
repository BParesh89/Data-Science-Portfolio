# Data-Science-Portfolio
This repository contains data science projects completed by me for self learning, competetions and hackathon.
They are presented in the form of jupyter notebooks(.ipynb) ,python scripts(.py) and kaggle kernels.

## Projects

### Machine learning

#### [Telecom Customer Churn](https://github.com/BParesh89/kaggle/tree/master/TelcoCustomerChurn)
This project is related to Churn analysis of customers in Telecom industry. Dataset for Telecom customer churn is picked up from [IBM Watson Sample datasets](https://www.ibm.com/communities/analytics/watson-analytics-blog/guide-to-sample-datasets/). This dataset contains total 7043 records. Each record is unique for a customer identified using feature customerID. Here the target column is Churn which contain values 'Yes' or 'No',so we need to classify whether customer with churn or not.Evaluation metric used here is roc-auc score and accuracy.I have compared performance of RandomForest and Logistic regression algorithms.This [notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/BParesh89/kaggle/blob/master/TelcoCustomerChurn/TelcoCustomerChurn.ipynb) contains analysis and prediction of this project and data is present in [project repository](https://github.com/BParesh89/kaggle/tree/master/TelcoCustomerChurn) in csv format.


#### [Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction(EDA only using Google BigQuery)](https://www.kaggle.com/bparesh/updated-eda-using-google-bigquery-sql)
This [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ga-customer-revenue-prediction) was hosted by RStudio on kaggle to predict revenue generated by customers on Google merchandise store. In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis using Google BigQuery and seaborn(visualization) as an experiment as Datasets were also available in form of bigquery datasets.My kaggle kernel for it can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/bparesh/updated-eda-using-google-bigquery-sql).


#### [Costa Rican Household Poverty Level Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/bparesh/costa-rican-household-poverty-eda-basic-model)
This [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction) was hosted by Inter-American Development Bank to predict the poverty level of people in Costa Rica to make sure the right people are given enough aid.It was a multi-class classification problem. In this project, I did exploratory data analysis,feature engineering(making new features using existing features, basically interaction features) and used logistic regerssion for classfication. Evaluation metrics used is F1-score. Kernel can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/bparesh/costa-rican-household-poverty-eda-basic-model). Also, my rank was 72 in this competetion.


#### [Microsoft Malware detection](https://github.com/BParesh89/Projects/blob/master/MicrosoftMalwareDetection/MicrosoftMalwareDetection_1.ipynb)
This project is based on competetion hosted by microsoft on kaggle to identify whether a given piece of file/software is a malware. 
It is a multiclass classification problem. Data is huge here(200 GB approx!). Metrics used in model evaluation is multiclass logloss. There are two types of files in data :asm files and bytes files. In this project, we extracted features from asm and bytes files. We tried different types of models like logistic regression, random forest & XgBoost. We are able to reduce logloss to 0.01.

### Web Scraping

#### [Scraping NIFTY50 stocks data from moneycontrol & Visualizing Top Gainers and Loosers](https://github.com/BParesh89/WebScraping-with-BeautifulSoup)

In this mini project, I have scraped data of NIFTY50(National Stock Exchange) stocks from [moneycontrol](https://www.moneycontrol.com/). First, I have scraped the stock names and url from [base page](https://www.moneycontrol.com/stocks/marketstats/indexcomp.php?optex=NSE&opttopic=indexcomp&index=9) of NIFTY50 from moneycontrol. After it, I have scraped some data like open-price, prev-close, today's low/high,up/down% etc from each stock webpage on moneycontrol into a dataframe. Then, I have made a bar plot of daily top gainers and top losers. This is my [project repository](https://github.com/BParesh89/WebScraping-with-BeautifulSoup).
