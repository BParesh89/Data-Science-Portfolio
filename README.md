# Data-Science-Portfolio
This repository contains data science projects completed by me for self learning, competetions and hackathon.
They are presented in the form of jupyter notebooks(.ipynb) ,python scripts(.py) and kaggle kernels.

## Projects

### Machine learning

#### Telecom Customer Churn
This project is related to Churn analysis of customers in Telecom industry. Dataset for Telecom customer churn is picked up from [IBM Watson Sample datasets](https://www.ibm.com/communities/analytics/watson-analytics-blog/guide-to-sample-datasets/). This dataset contains total 7043 records. Each record is unique for a customer identified using feature customerID. Here the target column is Churn which contain values 'Yes' or 'No',so we need to classify whether customer with churn or not.Evaluation metric used here is roc-auc score and accuracy.I have compared performance of RandomForest and Logistic regression algorithms.This [notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/BParesh89/kaggle/blob/master/TelcoCustomerChurn/TelcoCustomerChurn.ipynb) contains analysis and prediction of this project.


#### Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction(EDA only using Google BigQuery)
This [competetion](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ga-customer-revenue-prediction) was hosted by RStudio on kaggle to predict revenue generated by customers on Google merchandise store. In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis using Google BigQuery and seaborn(visualization) as an experiment as Datasets were also available in form of bigquery datasets.My kaggle kernel for it can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/bparesh/updated-eda-using-google-bigquery-sql).


#### Costa Rican Household Poverty Level Prediction
This [competetion](https://www.kaggle.com/c/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction) was hosted by Inter-American Development Bank to predict the poverty level of people in Costa Rica to make sure the right people are given enough aid.It was a multi-class classification problem. In this project, I did feature engineering(making new features using existing features, basically interaction features) and logistic regerssion for classfication. Evaluation metrics used is F1-score. Kernel can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/bparesh/costa-rican-poverty-logistic-model-425lb). Also, my rank was 72 in this competetion.
